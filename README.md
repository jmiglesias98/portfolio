# DATA SCIENTIST 
 
Mathematician working as a data scientist in the banking sector. I have 4 years of experience 
and I am characterized by having a transversal profile, since I have participated in data 
integrations, development of machine learning models or in the creation of dashboards, 
among others. I am an empathetic and outgoing person who likes to work as a team. In my 
free time I like to make plans with my friends and enjoy sports, especially running.
